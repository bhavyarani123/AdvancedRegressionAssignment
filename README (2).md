* [General Info](#general-information): A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. we are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- General information and Background about the project: A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file.
- Business goal: model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
-Building a linear regression model using regularization techniques offers improved generalization, better handling of multicollinearity, automatic feature selection, flexibility in balancing bias-variance trade-off, and enhanced interpretability. These benefits make regularization a valuable tool for improving the performance and reliability of linear regression models, particularly in scenarios with complex or high-dimensional datasets.

Building a linear regression model using regularization, such as ridge regression or lasso regression, offers several benefits:

Mitigating Overfitting: Regularization techniques help combat overfitting, which occurs when a model fits the training data too closely and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By adding a regularization term to the model's objective function, regularization constrains the coefficients or weights of the predictors, preventing them from taking large values. This helps control the model's complexity and reduces the likelihood of overfitting, resulting in improved generalization to new data.

Handling Multicollinearity: Multicollinearity refers to the presence of high correlation among predictors. In the presence of multicollinearity, the coefficients of the linear regression model become highly sensitive to small changes in the data, leading to instability and unreliable estimates. Regularization techniques, such as ridge regression, help address multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients, making them less sensitive to collinear predictors. This improves the stability and interpretability of the model.

Feature Selection: Lasso regression, in particular, has the property of performing automatic feature selection. It can drive the coefficients of irrelevant or less important predictors to zero, effectively removing them from the model. This feature selection capability is beneficial when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or when there is a suspicion that only a subset of predictors truly affects the target variable. By reducing the number of predictors, lasso regression can simplify the model, enhance interpretability, and potentially improve its performance.

Balancing Bias-Variance Trade-off: Regularization techniques allow for adjusting the bias-variance trade-off in the model. Increasing the regularization strength (lambda) leads to greater shrinkage of the coefficients, resulting in a more biased but lower-variance model. Conversely, decreasing the regularization strength leads to less shrinkage, resulting in a less biased but potentially higher-variance model. This flexibility enables finding an optimal trade-off that suits the specific problem at hand, balancing model complexity and generalization.

Enhanced Model Interpretability: Regularization can improve the interpretability of the linear regression model by reducing the impact of irrelevant predictors or noise in the data. By shrinking the coefficients of less important predictors, regularization helps highlight the predictors that have a stronger impact on the target variable. This simplifies the model interpretation and makes it easier to identify the most influential factors in the analysis.

Overall, building a linear regression model using regularization techniques offers improved generalization, better handling of multicollinearity, automatic feature selection, flexibility in balancing bias-variance trade-off, and enhanced interpretability. These benefits make regularization a valuable tool for improving the performance and reliability of linear regression models, particularly in scenarios with complex or high-dimensional datasets.
